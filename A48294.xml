            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A ſhort Model of a Bank,</head>
            <p>DIvide the Nation into precincts, as the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of places and the things ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire. Suppoſe two or three Hundreds into a precinct.</p>
            <p>Erect an Office in the moſt convenient places of each of theſe Precincts, on purpoſe to return Monies to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny part of the Nation to prevent High-way-Robbing.</p>
            <p>Order all greater payments to be made at theſe Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices to be atteſted by them, to prevent frauds, or elſe the payments ſhall not be good in Law.</p>
            <p>Order theſe Offices to be Caſhierers to all perſons, to keep any Mony for ſafety, they ſhall deſire to depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſit with them, and let the Office give the Depoſitor a Bill of credit for his mony, to repay it to him upon demand.</p>
            <p>Let theſe Bills be made transferrable.</p>
            <p>Let no Mony depoſited, in any of theſe Offices be li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to any Confiſcation or Forfeiture.</p>
            <p>That no man may diſtruſt the Credit of theſe Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, let the whole Precinct be obliged to make good all the acts of their Office, as the Hundred is bound to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair men robbed, as the Free-men of <hi>London</hi> make good the acts of the Lord Major, Court of Aldermen and Common-Counſil, and as the Nation makes good the Impoſitions of Parliament.</p>
            <p>That an intolerable incumbrance may not be brought upon the Eſtates of the Precinct, let every Precinct chooſe their ſtated Officers yearly, who ſhall give them ſecurity, that the Precinct ſhall not be damnified.</p>
            <p>Let the Precinct chooſe twenty four ſubſtantial per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to be aſſiſtants to the ſtated Officers, to meet once a Month to ſuperviſe them, leaſt they ſhould run out beyond their ſecurity.</p>
            <p>The ſtated Officers ſhall have power only to receive
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:34176:4"/>
               <!-- PDF PAGE 80 -->in Mony, and give out Bills of Credit for it, to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer theſe Bills with mony when they are brought un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, and being ſuperviſed once a Month, they cannot miſcarry much.</p>
            <p>The four and twenty ſhall be called in upon all occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions extraordinary, where there is any thing to be done, that requires hazard, they ſhall be to the ſtated Officers, as the Common Council is to the Court of Aldermen.</p>
            <p>Theſe aſſiſtants ſhall have power to diſperſe the Mony in ſpecie among the Neighbour-hood, at low in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, when any quantity lys dead in the Office; to be called in again, when the Office ſhall have occaſion for it: this will be a ſecurity againſt Violence, eſpecially when there are three or four hundred Offices, they cannot be riffed all at once.</p>
            <p>A Superiour Office muſt be erected at <hi>London,</hi> as the Center, to be as a head to all theſe inferior Offices, to give direction to them, as there ſhall be occaſion, theſe ſhall meddle with no Mony, but be a check to thoſe that do, and once a year ſhall balance the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts of all the inferiour Offices, to ſee what is got or loſt.</p>
            <p>Theſe Superior Officers may be choſen yearly by the aſſiſtants, one for an ordinary County, and more, for the larger Counties.</p>
            <p>Theſe Offices may be uſed for a voluntary Regiſter, if the Parliament pleaſes, and ſo this may be done at leſs charge.</p>
            <p>Theſe Offices and Officers may be eaſily maintained out of the clear profit of the Offices.</p>
            <p>Theſe conſtitutions will in a little time bring in the bulke of the running Caſh of the Nation to paſs through theſe Offices: for moſt of the Mony in the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is uſed in returns, or made in greater payments in three Months, or will be lodged here for ſafety, till
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:34176:4"/>
               <!-- PDF PAGE 80 -->the owner can find opportunity to lend it out, or lay it out; Now many perſons leave their Mony with Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens, whilſt they have nothing but the honeſty of the perſon ſuppoſed to have an Eſtate, for their ſecurity; here they have a better fund.</p>
            <p>When the Mony is in theſe Offices, it will keep there, becauſe it will be more ſafe, more portable, and more transferrable than caſh in the Cheſt, and ſo it will be better, as Gold is better than Silver.</p>
            <p>Eſpecially it will be better than Silver, if Bank Mony, or a Bill of Credit be made two in the hundred better than running caſh, which may be done with eaſe and ſafety.</p>
            <p>Upon theſe conſiderations every one will take a Bill of Credit, rather than Mony, whilſt they are ſure the fund is as good, as any mortal ſecurity can be.</p>
            <p>Firſt the Creditor hath the ſecurity of the Officer, who is ſuppoſed to be able and honeſt, and hath effects in his hands to anſwer all credit given out: but if through knavery or folly he hath imbezeled theſe.</p>
            <p>Secondly the Creditor hath the Eſtates of the whole Precincts real and perſonal, worth perhaps a Million or two, to make his Debt good, as in caſe of Robbing.</p>
            <p>Theſe things being admitted, it will neceſſarily follow theſe Offices will have a vaſt caſh, and a vaſter Credit, whilſt all accept their Bills, rather than Mony.</p>
            <p>This Credit having ſo good a fund will be equiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent to a vaſt treaſure, every way anſwering the ends and uſe of Mony, theſe Bills will buy what we want, and pay where we are indebted: becauſe the poſſeſſor of them may convert them into Mony, when he pleaſes.</p>
            <p>In caſe the Bills be too big for any mans uſe, ſuppoſe a Bill of 20 <abbr>
                  <hi>l.</hi>
               </abbr> and the poſſeſſor muſt pay labourers with it, he changes it, (that is ſels it) for Silver, as readily, as he could Gold, this is matter of fact at <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice,</hi> they give out Bills, ſeldome pay out mony, theſe
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:34176:5"/>
               <!-- PDF PAGE 81 -->Bills will readily chang into Dollars or Duckats, with advantage enough.</p>
            <p>Theſe Banks then will be in a condition by vertue of Mony loſt with them, and credit which by reaſon of their fund will be given to them, to lend Mony upon good ſecurity, at a low Intereſt, to all that will borrow.</p>
            <p>They will be in a capacity to buy what ever is to be ſold, homebred or foreign they think they can get by, their Credit will do all this, now become all the World over two <hi>per Cent.</hi> better then Sterling at the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket price.</p>
            <p>Theſe Banks will quickly make the effects of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ten times what they are now: and if ſome ſuch courſe as this be not ſuddenly taken, that the Crown and People of <hi>England</hi> may command Mony, as their Neighbours do, they muſt certainly become a Prey to them: <hi>Holland</hi> would in ſeven years, had they now Peace, get away our Trade; and any Neighbouring Country that commands Mony may hazard to ſeize our Nation, this expedient probably will help both, and heal all.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> 1. Men will not be willing, neither is it rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable the Parliament ſhould lay ſuch incumbrances upon all mens Eſtates, to anſwer for the acts of their Offices, where the Officers may run out if they pleaſe half the Precinct is worth.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer,</hi> I ſhall not need to tell you the Precinct chooſes their Officers every Month, they ſuperviſe them, they muſt undo themſelves, before they hurt the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinct, one word ſerves for all: The Eſtate of the whole Nation, now not worth twenty years purchaſe without this incumbrance, will be worth forty, if not fifty years purchaſe (as I have demonſtrated) with this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbrance upon it, therefore owners of Land will have no cauſe of complaint.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> 2. The People by theſe Bankes having Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:34176:5"/>
               <!-- PDF PAGE 81 -->in great plenty at a low intereſt, and being enabled to keep all their commodities for a Market, muſt needs be rich, then they will grow wanton, and be liable to rebel.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> Government is a ſecret thing, and eſteemed ſo by all, that live at eaſe and in peace and plenty, ſuch will be very wary how they make a diſturbance: it's Oppreſſion that makes wiſe men mad. A People never rebels, unleſs they are oppreſſed, or think themſelves ſo, or that ſuddenly they ſhall be ſo oppreſt; that if they be diſappointed in their rebellion, their caſe can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be much worſe. Fools may be wanton with Proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity, and weary of peace, Wiſe Men that know bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter things, will eaſily keep theſe in order: put perſons in employment, and deliver them from poverty, there is no fear of Rebellion.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> 3. When the Bulk of the Mony of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is brought into theſe Banks, it may be obnoxious to violence.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> Laws may be made as ſtrong as you pleaſe, that will be as a fence about theſe Banks, that all perſons offering violence to them, ſhall be obnoxious to ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt Juſtice, they are in ſeveral places, and cannot be violated at once, the Banks can diſperſe their Mony without any trouble among the Neighbourhood, as oft as they pleaſe, and doubtleſs will do it ten times before they be ſurpriſed once; this Bank at firſt muſt be a Mony Bank, but afterwards it riſes into a Credit Bank, and little Mony needs to be kept in ſpecie there.</p>
            <p>Theſe three are the moſt material objections, which I have anſwered more largely elſewhere, I have like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe ſpoken to leſs weighty and circumſtantial objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, I think fully and clearly in a larger diſcourſe.</p>
            <p>Any that pleaſe may ſee a larger diſcourſe of this Model at <hi>Mr. Millions</hi> a Bookſeller in <hi>Fleet-ſtreet</hi> near the <hi>Green Dragon Tavern,</hi> at the Sign of the <hi>Bible,</hi>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:34176:6"/>
               <!-- PDF PAGE 82 -->ſhewing the grounds and reaſons of the Model in the whole proceſs of it. The benefits that will accrue by it to the Nation in general, to the Crown, to the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, whether rich, poor, or of the middle ſort, how the Gentleman, the Husbandman, the Tradeſman, the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riner and the Merchant ſhall be advantaged. It is demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated how the practiſe of this Model may make <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> the Empire of the world, and the Mrs. of <hi>Europe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We may with the clear profits, put forward the Fiſhery, ſet up new Manufactures, incourage the old, and may in ſhort be, and do whatever a People would be, and could do, that hath an inexhauſtible treaſure.</p>
            <div type="part">
               <head>The Epitome of this Compendium is,</head>

               <p>Theſe four and twenty ſhall disperſe Mony lying dead in the Office, as oft as they pleaſe.</p>
               <p>Much of the running caſh of tha Nation will in a little time paſs through theſe Offices, and all that can will leave it there, and take a Bill of Credit of the Office: becauſe this Bill of Credit will be more ſafe, more portable, more transferable, and ſo of greater value than Mony, as Gold is (for theſe reaſons) better than Silver.</p>
               <p>Hence theſe Offices will have a vaſt Credit, which is equivalent to ſo much Mony in ſpecie, and may do whatever any can do, that have an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>exhauſtible treaſure.</p>
               <p>I beg no favour from any, nor acceptance of this Model, any further than the real worth of the thing deſerves, only I deſire no perſon would condemn it, before he hath peru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the larger diſcourſe.</p>
